This is the chisel intro for the TDT4255 course at NTNU.
If you use it for your cours, please let me know how it went and feel 
free (or even slightly pressured) to submit pull requests with improvements.

TODO: Installation instructions, link to scala primer and link to other tutorials.
Also lacking images, they're on the way.
