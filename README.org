This is the chisel intro for the TDT4255 course at NTNU.
If you use it for your course, please let me know how it went and feel 
free (or even slightly pressured) to submit pull requests with improvements.

In order to get started you should go through the introductory material:
Introduction to hardware description languages: [[./hdl.org]]

Instructions can be found in oppgavetekst.org (read it in github if your preferred
reader does not support .org markdown)


The main course(work) for creating a 5-stage RISCV pipeline can be found here
