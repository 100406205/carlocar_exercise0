This is the chisel intro for the TDT4255 course at NTNU.
If you use it for your course, please let me know how it went and feel 
free (or even slightly pressured) to submit pull requests with improvements.

Instructions can be found in oppgavetekst.org (read it in github if your preferred
reader does not support .org markdown)

TODO: Installation instructions, link to scala primer and link to other tutorials.
Also lacking images, they're on the way.

The main course(work) for creating a 5-stage RISCV pipeline can be found here
